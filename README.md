### Deployment

This section has moved 
https://github.com/mohamed1323/MY-TODO-APP.git

TodoProvider with useContext and useReducer
• Create a TodoContext using useContext to provide the state and dispatch function to the 
rest of the app.
• Use useReducer to manage the state of the todos (add, remove, toggle completion, and 
filter).
2. Managing References with useRef
• Use useRef in TodoForm to manage the input field reference for adding new todos.
3. Memoization with useCallback and useMemo
• Use useCallback for defining event handlers in TodoItem and TodoFilter to prevent 
unnecessary re-renders.
• Use useMemo to memoize the filtered list of todos based on the current filter.
4. Custom Hooks
• Create custom hooks to encapsulate common logic, such as managing local storage for 
persisting todos, or handling input changes.
