### Requirements
TodoProvider with useContext and useReducer
â€¢ Create a TodoContext using useContext to provide the state and dispatch function to the 
rest of the app.
â€¢ Use useReducer to manage the state of the todos (add, remove, toggle completion, and 
filter).
2. Managing References with useRef
â€¢ Use useRef in TodoForm to manage the input field reference for adding new todos.
3. Memoization with useCallback and useMemo
â€¢ Use useCallback for defining event handlers in TodoItem and TodoFilter to prevent 
unnecessary re-renders.
â€¢ Use useMemo to memoize the filtered list of todos based on the current filter.
4. Custom Hooks
â€¢ Create custom hooks to encapsulate common logic, such as managing local storage for 
persisting todos, or handling input changes.
